# CHANGELOG
## main (Unreleased)
-

## 1.1.0 (2025-05-23)
- Fix range operator to support beginless and endless ranges
- Fix `erb` block comments to add `<%#` to each line
  ```erb
  <ul>
    <%# <% @foos.each do |foo| %>
    <%#   <li><%= foo %></li>
    <%# <% end %>
  </ul>
  ```
  - **Note**: Somewhat `BREAKING` across text editors as there does not seem to be a universally agreed upon approach for `.erb` block comments. This approach is the closest to making it work as expected. For `html` only lines, such as `<%# <ul>`, an `erb` commenting out does not _actually_ comment the line and a manual `<!-- <ul> -->` is needed. In its entirety the correct approach should have a combination like the below. However, there seems to be a VSCode limitation in not being able to add a combination approach for line commenting. 
    ```erb
    <!-- <ul>
      <%# <% @foos.each do |foo| %>
      <%#   <li><%= foo %></li>
      <%# <% end %>
    </ul> -->
    ```
